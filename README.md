# ProjectPi
Final project module 2

Place UDPServerJoris.jar in a folder from which you want to download/to which you want to upload files and place UDPClientJoris.jar in another (or the same, if you want) folder from which you want to upload/to which you want to download these files. These folders can be on different machines (the server can for example be on a Raspberry Pi!), provided they are on the same network. Now execute both .jar files, the order in which you do this does not matter. A connection between the client and the server will be established and a menu will pop up on the client side, informing you of the commands that you can give.
